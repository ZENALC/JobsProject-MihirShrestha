A NoSQL database like MongoDB would be preferable for an extremely small project like this in my opinion.

As you can see from my jobs.py file, the SQL functions were very long and kind of convoluted in comparison
to the simple function that I made for MongoDB.

Also, the JSON file format that we used for these sprints would've been a perfect
fit for MongoDB as it is made to work naturally with that from the beginning.

However, with SQL databases, you have to create columns first, and then finally insert it by mapping each dictionary's
key to its respective column in the database.

All in all, I would prefer the use of SQL databases if my program would need more than about a hundred thousand entries of data; however,
if I were working on a project as small as this and with a data-format like JSON, I would undoubtedly use a database like MongoDB and
use the extra time and energy I get from not having to deal with SQL to implement additional functions in my main program.
